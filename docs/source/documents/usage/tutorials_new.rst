Tutorials for New Algorithms
================================

As a flexible deep reinforcement learning library, it is easy for newers to extend new algorithms to XuanCe
and build customized algorithms based on XuanCe.
As is mentioned in :doc:`here <../../index>`, an algorithm consists of four components,namely representation, policy, learner, and agent.
Hence, one can create a customized algorithm by the following steps.
